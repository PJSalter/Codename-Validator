### This was a prompt where I had to run all HTML, CSS and Javascript, this included an input box to type in the codename, the input is a string and a button once clicked will pop up a message on screen, my styling was crocodile themed to make it interactive.

### Within the JavaScript I wrote a function that checked the length of the string, this will have a true or false statement whether it's five characters long or not.

### Then I wrote a function that checks if the codename will have at least one lowercase and at least one uppercase letter, I did this with regex on finding out the pattern and then using regex method of test to see if the regex worked, test is known as a string method. When both are typed in the input box at the same time then the function will equal true and if one is then missing then it would equal false. Numbers will count as lowercase.

### Then I used the magical Dom Manipulation to place connect all these functions together, i checked different values of codes once typed and clicked to see what was a correct codename or incorrect codename. Onece all functions were true when clicked I gave it a message that popped up saying it was correct and if it wasn't then an incorrect message will pop up on the screen with my own styling.
